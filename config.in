# This name is used for printing purposes 
# I suggest to use a format: `month-name year`
PROB_NAME="December 2018"

# Define the path to `oplrun` exe
OPLRUN="/opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio128/opl/bin/x86-64_linux/oplrun"

# Folders of the project
# I organized the software in 3 main dirs: `models`, `data`, `out`.
# But you can define these folders as you prefer.
OUT_DIR="out"
MOD_DIR="models"
DATA_DIR="data"

# PROBLEM 1: Classic Library Rostering problem with balanced assignment according to min-max shifts per student
# Define the model file
MOD_PROB_1="LibraryModel_getCSV.mod"

# The Data file is created in `online mode` (polling Doodle and configuring the ILP problem). Instead, the Data file is used in `offline mode` to solve the problem. Then, it MUST exist to run the software with `offline` parameter.
DATA_PROB_1="CSLibrary_Dec2018.dat"

# Finally, the output file is created by the software at the end of execution and contain a precise representation of the assignment.
OUT_PROB_1="CSLibrary_Dec2018.xlsx"

# PROBLEM 2: Minimize the number of trips required to cover all the month
# This model doesn't implement load balancing in the assignment, then I suggest you to specify the min number of shifts to equally distribute shifts among students.
